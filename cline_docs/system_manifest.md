# System: CRCT Submodule

## Purpose
Provides a structured framework for recursive chain-of-thought reasoning and project management, configured to operate as a submodule with all output stored within the submodule directory.

## Architecture
[parent_project] --> [src] + [docs]
                 |
                 +--> [.crct] --> [cline_docs] + [cline_utils]
                       |
                       +--> [.clinerules] (submodule config)
                       |
[.clinerules-parent] --+

## Module Registry
- [src]: Core implementation code (in parent repository)
- [docs]: Project documentation (in parent repository)
- [.crct/cline_docs]: CRCT system operational memory
- [.crct/cline_utils]: CRCT system utilities, including dependency tracking

## Development Workflow
1. Initialize the CRCT system as a submodule
2. Configure the system to store all output in the submodule directory
3. Run dependency analysis to populate trackers
4. Verify and resolve placeholder dependencies
5. Proceed with the standard CRCT workflow (Strategy → Execution → Cleanup/Consolidation)
