# Business Model Canvas Template

## Overview
The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management template for developing and documenting business models. This BRCT-enhanced version includes the standard nine components of the canvas while incorporating recursive decomposition and chain-of-thought reasoning.

**Pricing Strategy:**
[Details of pricing approach]

**Revenue Projections:**
[Preliminary revenue estimates]

**Recursive Analysis:**

- [Resource 2]

**Intellectual Resources:**
- [Resource 1]
- [Resource 2]

**Human Resources:**
- [Resource 1]
- [Resource 2]

**Financial Resources:**
- [Resource 1]

- [Activity 1]
- [Activity 2]

**Recursive Analysis:**
- [Break down activities into sub-processes]
- [Analyze activity dependencies and bottlenecks]

### 8. Key Partnerships
*Who are our key partners and suppliers?*

**Strategic Partnerships:**
- [Partner 1]
- [Partner 2]

**Supplier Relationships:**
- [Supplier 1]
- [Supplier 2]

**Partnership Rationale:**
- [Optimization reasons]
- [Risk reduction aspects]
- [Resource acquisition benefits]

**Recursive Analysis:**

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

**Key Insights:**
[Document important realizations about the business model]

**Critical Dependencies:**
[Identify and document crucial dependencies between components]

**Potential Innovations:**
[Areas where the business model could be innovated]

## Validation Plan

**Key Assumptions to Test:**

**Success Criteria:**
[Criteria for determining if the business model is validated]
