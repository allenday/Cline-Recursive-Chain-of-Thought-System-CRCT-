# Business Idea Generation Template

## Overview
This template guides users through a structured approach to business idea generation using the BRCT framework's recursive decomposition methodology.

## Template Components

### 1. Problem Definition

**Business Challenge:**
[Define the specific business problem or opportunity]

**Target Users/Customers:**
[Identify the primary users or customers affected by this problem]

**Current Solutions and Limitations:**
[Describe existing approaches and their shortcomings]

### 2. Idea Generation Methods

#### Brainstorming Session
- **Participants:** [List the people involved in the brainstorming]
- **Duration:** [Time spent on brainstorming]
- **Techniques Used:** [e.g., Round Robin, Mind Mapping, Reverse Thinking]

**Raw Ideas List:**
1. [Idea 1]
2. [Idea 2]
3. ...

#### Recursive Decomposition
Break down the problem into smaller components using the BRCT approach:

**Component 1:** [Name of sub-problem]
- Potential Solutions:
  1. [Solution 1.1]
  2. [Solution 1.2]
  
**Component 2:** [Name of sub-problem]
- Potential Solutions:
  1. [Solution 2.1]
  2. [Solution 2.2]

### 3. Idea Refinement

**Top 3-5 Ideas to Explore:**
1. **[Idea Name]**
   - Description: [Brief explanation]
   - Uniqueness: [What makes this idea different]
   - Key Assumptions: [Critical assumptions to validate]
   
2. **[Idea Name]**
   - Description: [Brief explanation]
   - Uniqueness: [What makes this idea different]
   - Key Assumptions: [Critical assumptions to validate]

### 4. Next Steps

**Selected Ideas for Further Evaluation:**
- [List ideas moving to evaluation phase]

**Research Needed:**
- [Specific information needed to validate ideas]

**Dependencies:**
- [List dependencies for proceeding with these ideas]

## Chain-of-Thought Documentation

**Reasoning Process:**
[Document the step-by-step reasoning process that led to the final set of ideas]

**Insights and Patterns:**
[Note any patterns, themes, or insights observed during the idea generation process]

**Alternative Directions Considered:**
