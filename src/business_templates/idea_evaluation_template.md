# Business Idea Evaluation Template

## Overview
This template provides a structured framework for evaluating business ideas using the BRCT methodology, focusing on feasibility, viability, and desirability criteria.

## Idea Summary

| Differentiation potential | | [How different is this from existing solutions?] |
| Timing | | [Why now? Is the market ready?] |

**Desirability Score:** [Average of above scores]

**Reasoning:** [Explain the reasoning behind the desirability assessment]

### 2. Feasibility (Implementation Capability)

| Criterion | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Technical complexity | | [How technically challenging is implementation?] |
| Resource requirements | | [People, time, capital needed] |
| Dependencies | | [External factors required for success] |
| Regulatory/compliance | | [Regulatory barriers or requirements] |
| Implementation timeline | | [Time to first prototype and full launch] |

**Reasoning:** [Explain the reasoning behind the feasibility assessment]

### 3. Viability (Business Model)

| Criterion | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Revenue potential | | [Size of potential revenue] |
| Profit margin | | [Expected profit margins] |
| Customer acquisition cost | | [Cost to acquire customers] |
| Lifetime value | | [Expected customer lifetime value] |
| Time to break-even | | [When will the idea become profitable?] |

**Viability Score:** [Average of above scores]

**Reasoning:** [Explain the reasoning behind the viability assessment]

### 4. Strategic Alignment

| Criterion | Score (1-5) | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Alignment with company vision | | [How well does it fit the company's direction?] |
| Synergy with existing products | | [How does it complement current offerings?] |

| Brand fit | | [Alignment with company brand and values] |

**Strategic Alignment Score:** [Average of above scores]

**Reasoning:** [Explain the reasoning behind the strategic alignment assessment]

## Overall Evaluation

**Composite Score:** [Weighted average of all scores]

**SWOT Analysis:**

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| [Strength 1] | [Weakness 1] |
| [Strength 2] | [Weakness 2] |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---------------|---------|
| [Opportunity 1] | [Threat 1] |
| [Opportunity 2] | [Threat 2] |

## Risk Assessment

**Key Risks:**
1. [Risk 1]
   - Probability: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Mitigation Strategy: [How to address this risk]

2. [Risk 2]
   - Probability: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Impact: [High/Medium/Low]
   - Mitigation Strategy: [How to address this risk]

## Recursive Decomposition Analysis

Break down the idea into its key components and evaluate each separately:

**Component 1:** [Name]
- Evaluation: [Brief assessment]
- Critical Dependencies: [What this component depends on]

**Component 2:** [Name]
- Evaluation: [Brief assessment]
- Critical Dependencies: [What this component depends on]

## Chain-of-Thought Documentation

**Key Insights from Evaluation:**
[Document important realizations and insights]

**Alternative Approaches Considered:**
[Document alternatives that were considered]

**Decision Rationale:**
[Explain the reasoning behind the final recommendation]

## Recommendation

**Final Recommendation:** [Proceed/Modify/Reject]

**Reasoning:** [Explanation of the recommendation]

**Next Steps:** [If proceeding, what should happen next]
