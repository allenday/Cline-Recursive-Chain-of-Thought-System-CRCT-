# SWOT Analysis Template

## Overview
This template guides users through a comprehensive SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis using the BRCT framework's recursive decomposition approach. This enhanced SWOT analysis incorporates chain-of-thought reasoning and dependency tracking to create a more thorough strategic assessment.
