# Business Recursive Chain-of-Thought (BRCT) Templates

## Overview

This directory contains templates designed for the Business Recursive Chain-of-Thought (BRCT) framework, which adapts the Cline Recursive Chain-of-Thought System (CRCT) for business innovation processes. These templates provide structured approaches to various aspects of business innovation while incorporating the principles of recursive decomposition and explicit chain-of-thought reasoning.

## Template Usage

These templates should be used throughout the business innovation process to ensure comprehensive analysis, thorough documentation, and structured thinking. To use a template:

1. Create a new file in your project with a descriptive name
2. Copy the content from the appropriate template
3. Fill in the sections with your specific information
4. Document your chain-of-thought reasoning in the designated sections
5. Track dependencies using the Business Dependency Tracker

## Available Templates

### [Idea Generation Template](./idea_generation_template.md)
Use this template to document the process of generating new business ideas. It guides you through problem definition, ideation techniques, and recursive decomposition of complex business challenges.

### [Idea Evaluation Template](./idea_evaluation_template.md)
This template provides a structured framework for evaluating business ideas based on feasibility, viability, and desirability criteria. It includes sections for risk assessment and recursive analysis of idea components.

### [Business Model Canvas](./business_model_canvas.md)
An enhanced version of the standard Business Model Canvas that incorporates recursive decomposition and chain-of-thought reasoning into each of the nine components of a business model.

### [SWOT Analysis Template](./swot_analysis_template.md)
This template guides users through a comprehensive SWOT analysis with additional sections for recursive decomposition, dependency tracking, and explicit reasoning documentation.

### [Market Research Template](./market_research_template.md)
Use this template to structure market research activities, including market overview, competitive analysis, customer analysis, and opportunity assessment, all with a recursive approach.

## Integration with BRCT Framework

These templates are designed to be used in conjunction with the broader BRCT framework. Each template:

1. **Incorporates Recursive Decomposition** - Breaks complex business concepts into smaller, manageable components
2. **Documents Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Includes sections for explicitly recording reasoning processes
3. **Tracks Dependencies** - Identifies relationships between different business factors
4. **Supports Phase-Based Workflow** - Can be used across Set-up/Maintenance, Strategy, and Execution phases

## Dependencies

For tracking relationships between business factors across templates, refer to the [Business Dependency Tracker](../business_dependency_tracker.md). This tracker helps identify and manage the complex web of dependencies that influence business innovation outcomes.

## Customization

While these templates provide comprehensive starting points, they should be adapted to your specific business needs. Feel free to:

- Add or remove sections as needed for your particular innovation challenge
- Adjust the level of detail based on the scope and complexity of your project
- Create new templates for additional business innovation activities following the same principles

## Best Practices

- Complete all relevant sections to ensure comprehensive analysis
- Be explicit in documenting your reasoning process
- Update the Business Dependency Tracker as you discover new relationships between factors
- Revisit and refine templates as you gather more information
- Create mini-trackers for complex dependency relationships within specific areas

Remember that the BRCT framework emphasizes transparency in reasoning and structured approaches to complex business problems. The templates support this by providing clear frameworks for documenting your thinking and analysis.
